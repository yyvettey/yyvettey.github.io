excerpt: 'In seek for a highly generalizable large-scale ReID method, we present an adversarialdomain-invariant feature learning framework (ADIN) that explicitly learns to separate identity-related features from challenging variations, where for the first time “free” annotations in ReID data such as video timestamp and camera index are utilized.'
